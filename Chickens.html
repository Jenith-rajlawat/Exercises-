    <h1><b>Chicken WereWolf </b></h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a
      subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). Chickens are one of the
      most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of
      23.7 billion as of 2018.[1] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] There
      are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated
      fowl.[2] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming
      both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised
      for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for
      food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[3][4] Genetic
      studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast
      Asia, and East Asia,[5] but with the clade found in the Americas, Europe,
      the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent. From
      ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia
      Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[6] Fowl had been known in
      Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every 
      day" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar,
      Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.<sup><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp">[7][8][9]</a></sup>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>
      <div>  Model of a chicken.</div> Didactic model of a chicken. In the UK and
      as cocks, whereas in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand,
      Ireland, adult male chickens over <span>age</span>  of one year are primarily known
      they are more commonly called roosters. Males less than a year old are
      cockerels.[10] Castrated or neutered roosters are called capons (surgical
      and chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world).
      Females over a year old are known as hens, and younger females as
      pullets,[11] although in the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen
      when she begins to lay eggs, at 16 to 20 weeks of age. The young are
      called chicks. In Australia and New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain),
      there is a generic term chook /tʃʊk/ to describe all ages and both
      sexes.[12]
